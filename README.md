# Mouse Activity Simulator

This program ensures that your status remains "online" by simulating mouse activity. Specifically, the mouse moves slightly every 10 seconds and performs a single click. It is designed for use with platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack to prevent your status from changing to "away."

## How to Set Up

You have two options to set up the required environment:

1. **Run the `setup.bat` file**  
   This will automatically install all required dependencies. Simply double-click the file and follow the instructions.

2. **Install requirements manually**  
   If you prefer to do it yourself, run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
