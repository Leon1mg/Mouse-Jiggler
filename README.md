# Mouse Activity Simulator

This program ensures that your status stays "online" by simulating mouse activity.
Specifically, the mouse moves slightly every 10 seconds and performs a single click.
It's designed for use with platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack to prevent the status from switching to "away."
